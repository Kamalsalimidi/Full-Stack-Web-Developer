Computers only understand 0's and 1's

# js

* variables are loosely coupled
* Only one line runs at a time unlike other programs
* scripted language

sync means sequential
async means parallel
  * contact switching (switch to another task)
  * delegate (say someone to do this)
 setTimeout, fs.readFile, Fetch
